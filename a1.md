# **Solving the Crossword puzzle algorithm**

I solved the puzzle algorithm by fillPuzzle() first. I divided this up into four subsections: 
solving the '+' , predefined letter, '-' , and the digit cases. The overall idea was to add the value
to the board, StringBuilders, and HashMap, and check if the letter was a valid word/prefix as well as making sure
the letter did not exceed a digit limit we were on a digit square. If the letter was valid, I recursively called
fillPuzzle() and stored and updated two global variables, row & col, to help index my way around the board. That way if we
returned from a recursive call, we could then retrieve the previous indexing and go to the next letter in that call.

## **fillPuzzle**

### Initialize the Data Structures

The process for fillPuzzle starts by initializing the StringBuilders array with StringBuilders for each row and column. Then,
it initializes the HashMap that is used to determine the letters frequency as well as it's limit (if the letter happened to 
land on a digit square)

### What's the character at the square?

There were four cases: '+', '-', a predefined letter, and a digit case. I ran an if else statement for determing what value was at
the current square I was at.

### The '+' and Digit Case

From a-z, a letter is added to the board and StringBuilders. Then the HashMap values are retrieved. We first check if we have a limit to how many times the letter can appear, and if it's greater than the limit, we simply go to the next letter. We then check if the below square would make the current letter a valid placement, if this is false, we simply remove the letter from the board and StringBuilders. Then we check if the letter makes valid words/prefixes for both the column and row based upon where we are on the board. If this is false, we delete the letter and go to the next. If all of these hold true, we then move to the next square. If we get to 'z' and no letter has been valid, return null and backtrack to the previous recursive call.

### The Predefined Letter Case

Similar to the '+' case, but instead of looping all of the alphabet, if the letter at the square was not valid, simly return null and backtrack to the previous call.

### The '-' Case

Started by adding the '-' to the StringBuilders. Then I simply checked if the current strings for the row and columns were valid words, if they were, I moved on to the next square, if not, I returned null and backtracked to the previous call.

## **checkPuzzle**

checkPuzzle works very simply. It goes through the entire board - rows and columns - and adds each letter it goes by to a temporary StringBuilder. If it a '-' it immediately stops and checks if the current string is a valid word. If it gets to the end of a row or column, without hitting a '-', it then checks if it's a word. If every row and column is a word, then it returns true.

## **Debugging**

The issues I had were with the edge case of returning 'z' from two consecutive recursive pops. I realized that I needed to delete the letter as soon as I returned from the call. I also had a problem with the HashMap values being garbage values when I tried to get them. So, I made a method that would check the occurence of a given letter so I knew I was always getting correct values.

# **Asymptotic Analysis**

The core method is a recursive function fillPuzzle. At the worst case, the program can be as deep as the size of the crossboard K^2. This leads to a O(K^2). Inside the recursive method, there is a do... while loop that iterates over the entire alphabet, 26 letters, in the worst case. this would result in O(26). Overall fillPuzzle dominates the runtime complexity. This time results in O(26 * (K^2)), but extracting the constants and multiplitives, the worst case runtime is O(n^2).
